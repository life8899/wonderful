1. interrupt handling:
 1. hardware stacks program counter,etc
 2. hardware loads new program counter from interrupt vector.
 3. assembly language procedure saves registers
 4. assembly language procedure sets up new stack
 5. C interrupt serviceruns (typically reads and buffers input).
 6. Scheduler decide swhich process is to run next
 7. C procedure returns to the assembly code
 8. Assembly language procedure starts up new current process.

2. look at hw1, lab1-3

3. fork implementation

4. address space, 4 elements of an address space

5. process life cycle: process state diagram

6. the thread model chart

7. the user level thread is in app.
   the kernel level thread is in kernel.

8.  3 benefits of user level thread:
user has more control over schedule


downside: blcoking system call

hybrid thread

9 schedule algorithms

10 multi level feedback queue

hw2
1.
state hungery means you want to take forks.
the test function checks
after take forks we check I is really hungery

2. starvation

3. readers writers problem (wikipedia)

4. he will post the slides to the solution
